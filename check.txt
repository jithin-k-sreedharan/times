Dynamic networks are used to represent important processes in diverse
applications, from spread of infectious diseases to flow of capital in
economic systems. The arrival order of nodes in such networks reveals
critical insights into their structural and functional organization.
In typical applications, the state of a dynamic network is available
as a single snapshot in time, e.g., the current state of infection.
One must infer a node arrival order from this snapshot, using additional
insights into the generation process for the dynamic graph. We show that
for commonly used generation processes, it is impossible to recover total
node arrival order with vanishing probability of error. In view of this
result, we formulate a more general problem that infers a {\em partial order}
of node arrivals by grouping nodes into bins and establishing an
order of arrivals across these bins. For this problem, we obtain bounds
on tradeoff between accuracy and number of predictions, and present
algorithms for partial order recovery, whose empirical performance
approaches theoretical bounds. We validate our methods through experiments
on both synthetic and real networks, including the Facebook wall post
and the human brain Connectome datasets. We draw novel insights into
the functional and structural organization of these dynamic networks.
